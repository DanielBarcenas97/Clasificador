After staging a war between worlds in Independence Day: Resurgence, Roland Emmerich mounts a world at war in Midway. A passion project for the German director — it’s been gestating since the ’90s — the film charts the lead up to the battle of Midway, the fight for domination between the US and Japan for the geographically crucial atoll that became a turning point in the war in the Pacific. The slice of history has been filmed before by Jack Smight in 1976 with an all-star cast (Heston! Fonda! Coburn! Mifune!), new-fangled audio process Sensurround and a great John Williams score. Yet despite better production values (if lower star wattage), Emmerich’s take doesn’t really up the ante on it, suffering from bloat and a similar lack of directorial intelligence.
