New England, the 1890s. Two lighthouse keepers arrive on a remote island for a month-long stretch of maintenance and solitude. But mysteries abound: both men harbour secrets, strange visions and hallucinations appear, and when relief doesn’t arrive, their grip on reality starts to loosen.

Early on in The Lighthouse, director Robert Eggers’ dazzling, demented follow-up to The Witch, veteran lighthouse keeper Thomas Wake (Willem Dafoe) recounts how the last keeper (or ‘wickie’, to use the naval parlance) went mad, after believing there was “some enchantment in the light”. Ephraim Winslow (Robert Pattinson), the replacement wickie, scoffs at this. “Tall tales,” he says.

The Lighthouse is itself a tall tale, the kind sailors might have once told over a frothy tankard of ale with a faraway look in their eyes. It is a folk tale deeply rooted in that tradition, soaked to the salty skin with superstition and sinister iconography. And yet... The Lighthouse is an altogether taller tale than most. There are plenty of moments where you’ll have no bloody idea what you’re watching. Other times it feels like an endurance test — like you’ve been stranded on an island in a storm with little chance of rescue. But surrender yourself to its strangeness and you might also find some enchantment in its light.
