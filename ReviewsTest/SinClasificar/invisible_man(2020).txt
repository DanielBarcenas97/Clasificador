In James Whale’s 1933 adaptation of HG Wells’ classic sci-fi horror, Claude Rains plays Dr Jack Griffin as a mad scientist, a rational man driven insane by a serum which alters his body’s refractive index. In this latest reboot from writer-director Leigh Whannell, the invisibility comes not from a serum but from an optical suit, dozens of cameras mounted on a military-grade onesie, conceptually based on an extension of existing camouflage technology. The more important difference here, though, is that the man in the suit was bad before he became invisible.

Remodelling the Invisible Man (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) into a domestic abuser feels like conspicuously timely subject matter. In the #MeToo era, it’s something being talked about more than ever. But Whannell’s bold approach never feels like bandwagon-hopping. Here, the invisibility concept is a compellingly appropriate means to explore abusive relationships, agoraphobia, gaslighting and toxic masculinity. There is a universal and uncomfortably real impact to the horrors on show here. Which, inevitably, will make it a tough watch for some.
