The sequel to the absolutely average 2016 Trolls movie is very much more of the same, with a greater sprinkling of famous voices. After finally getting everything in Auto-Tuned harmony at the end of the last film, the Trolls are now threatened by a new foe. It turns out that the pop-loving trolls we know are not the only music lovers on the Troll planet. There are different tribes – funk, classical, techno, etc. – and one of those tribes, the rock Trolls, led by ever-angry Barb (Rachel Bloom), wants to force the others to stop grooving and start moshing.
