Parasite is a difficult film to talk about. It defies any easy pigeonhole, wriggles free from slotting into a single genre, can be considered both a mainstream crowd-pleaser and an arthouse masterpiece — and is, undeniably, a film best enjoyed going in blind, its delicious and shocking surprises ideally experienced as innocently and obliviously as possible. So, finding words to describe it are hard. If there’s one word that can best sum it up, it’s the director: Bong Joon Ho.

Parasite is pure Bong, which is to say that it is many things at once. From his 2000 debut, Barking Dogs Never Bite, onwards, the Korean auteur has had an itchy, restless mind, never settling on tone or subject matter, darting from horror to thriller to dystopian sci-fi to vegan monster movie — sometimes within the same film — sucking up influences from both Hollywood (Spielberg, Hitchcock) and his native Korea (Kim Ki-young, Lee Chang-dong) along the way. His hallmark is his multitudes.
